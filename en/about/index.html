<p>After working on a physics research degree that involved computer simulations, I knew that I really enjoyed the problem-solving part of programming, but missed working in a team and being able to see the impact of my work.</p>
<p>This, together with talking with web devs, playing with HTML & CSS in my spare time - plus doing a fascinating short (two- day) UX course - convinced me that I want to become a web developer.</p>
<p>I've now just completed an immersive 12-week General Assembly Web Development course, where I’ve combined front-end styling and frameworks like Angular.js, with back- end databases, cloud-hosting and much more and I am ready for a full-time junior web development role.</p>
<p>My ideal team would be multi-disciplinary, with members who are excited about the projects they’re working on.</p>
<p>When not web-dev-ing, I enjoy reading comics, going to <a href="https://nineworlds.co.uk/">cons</a>, and taking part in <a href="https://www.anthonynolan.org/">Anthony Nolan</a> charity events to raise the need for blood stem cell donors.</p>
