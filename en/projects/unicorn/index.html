This site is a place to find a shelter for your unicorn (i.e. a workspace for your startup).

It uses the Google Maps API to display these and Google Places API for the search bar to autocomplete places and their metadata. 

It has a RESTful API in Node & Express.

We designed & developed it as a team of three over one week. 

I am now looking to extend its reach by using national and international APIs that have startup & workspace data.
