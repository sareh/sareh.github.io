This app was inspired by conversations at [UKHealthCamp](https://twitter.com/UKHealthCamp) with therapists and other medical professionals. They said that many of their patients liked using online services.

I noted that many of them are not open sourced. 

The build

JavaScript • HTML5 • CSS3 • Sass • Bower • Gulp • Angular.js • Node.js • Express • MongoDB • Heroku • Git

Future work: to complete the project.
