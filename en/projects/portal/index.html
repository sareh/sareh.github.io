A site for university students to upload and share services that they sorely need.

This site is mobile-first, built from the start with accessibility in mind.

It was created to meet the need of 40,000 UCL students who find it difficult to find services.

The build

JavaScript • HTML5 • CSS3 • Ruby on Rails • ActiveRecord • Postgresql • Foundation • Amazon Web Services • Heroku • Git • Trello


I have deployed onto Heroku and will conduct further user testing soon, in conjunction with current UCL students. I have talked with  UCL's technology division (ISD) about giving them access to my API, so that they can improve the ucl.ac.uk search, with the crowdsourced resources.

I am talking with UCL’s technology division about incorporating student login and creating an API that their official search service can use.
